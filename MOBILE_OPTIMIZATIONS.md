# Mobile Optimizations for Chess Game

## Overview
The chess game has been optimized for mobile devices with responsive design, touch interactions, and improved user experience.

## Key Mobile Optimizations

### 1. Responsive Design
- **Flexible Layout**: The chessboard now scales responsively using CSS Grid and aspect-ratio
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design starts with mobile and scales up to desktop
- **Breakpoint System**: Uses Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (md:, lg:)
- **Text Scaling**: Font sizes adjust based on screen size using clamp() and responsive classes

### 2. Touch Interactions
- **Touch Detection**: Automatically detects touch devices and switches interaction mode
- **Tap-to-Select**: On mobile, tap a piece to select it, then tap destination square
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected pieces and valid moves are highlighted
- **Drag & Drop**: Maintained for desktop users, disabled on touch devices

### 3. Mobile-Specific Features
- **Prevent Zoom**: Prevents accidental zoom on double-tap
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for better accessibility
- **Orientation Support**: Handles landscape and portrait orientation changes
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during game state changes

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized board rendering for mobile devices
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners
- **Smooth Animations**: Hardware-accelerated CSS transitions

### 5. Accessibility
